# JavaScript-Battle-System
JavaScript built Battle System for a web game, complete with an editing guide and everything you need to add this to your web game!

# Details

This project was a personal solo project just for the fun of it.  I thought, what's something fun that I could also add to a portfolio?
And I thought I'd build a turn-based video game battle system.

This works like this:

Player 1 chooses an attack or spell, uses it, then it's Player 2's turn.  Very simple.

# Guide Included?

In the editing guide folder, there's instructions on how to make a game out of this, as well as a file that lists each function and what they do,
and lists each variable and what they do!

I put a lot of effort into this, but I do not intend to make a full game out of it.  But I built it with hopes that a good front-end
engineer and their back-end engineer buddy would use this to build thier masterpiece.
